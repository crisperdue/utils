Title: This is only a test
---

## Introduction

We are entering text in Markdown. The goal will be to work with Jekyll layouts
and themes to make it easy to create web sites, not just static web sites,
but web applications that can interact with backends.

<pre>
Ain't it grand, we have
preformatted text.
</pre>

`[[A => (B | C)]]`

<p class=math>
A ⇒ (B ∨ C)
</p>

This is further testing of the darned thing.

Till thick and fast they came at last,
and more and more and more.
